# Overview

KotlinChat is a real-time messaging app designed to enhance my understanding of Kotlin and Firebase for mobile development. This project focuses on implementing user authentication, real-time message synchronization, and a responsive user interface using Jetpack Compose.

The purpose of creating this software is to build a fully functional chat application while deepening my knowledge of cloud-based databases, real-time data handling, and mobile UI/UX principles. By developing KotlinChat, I aim to strengthen my skills in Android development and gain hands-on experience with Firebase Firestore.
